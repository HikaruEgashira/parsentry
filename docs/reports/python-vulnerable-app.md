# Python Vulnerable App - Vulnerability Report

## Analysis Summary

**Confidence Score:** 80 (ðŸŸ  Medium-High)

**Detected Vulnerability Types:**
- SQL Injection (SQLI)
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Remote Code Execution (RCE)

## Vulnerability Analysis

The following endpoints contain user input that is passed directly to dangerous operations without validation or sanitization, resulting in serious vulnerabilities:

### 1. SQL Injection (/sqli)
User input is embedded into SQL queries through simple string concatenation, allowing execution of arbitrary queries with payloads like `' OR '1'='1`.

### 2. Cross-Site Scripting (/xss)
User input is directly embedded into HTML output without escaping, allowing script injection for users visiting the page.

### 3. Command Injection/RCE (/cmdi)
User input is passed directly to shell commands for execution, allowing arbitrary command execution like `; rm -rf /`.

The impact includes information leakage, theft of administrative data, and server takeover, evaluated as extremely severe.

## Proof of Concept (PoC)

### 1) SQL Injection
```
GET /sqli?username=' OR '1'='1
```

### 2) Cross-Site Scripting
```
GET /xss?name=<script>alert('XSS')</script>
```

### 3) Command Injection
```
GET /cmdi?hostname=localhost;uname -a;
```

## Code Context

### Function: sql_injection
- **Issue:** User input is directly concatenated into SQL statements, enabling SQL injection
- **Code:** `query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '{username}'"`
- **Location:** example/python-vulnerable-app/app.py:19

### Function: xss
- **Issue:** User input is embedded into HTML without escaping, causing reflected XSS
- **Code:** `<div>Hello, {name}!</div>`
- **Location:** example/python-vulnerable-app/app.py:35

### Function: command_injection
- **Issue:** User input is executed directly as shell commands, enabling command injection
- **Code:** `output = os.popen(f"ping -c 1 {hostname}").read()`
- **Location:** example/python-vulnerable-app/app.py:50

## Analysis Notes

Identified three distinct vulnerabilities: SQLI, XSS, RCE via cmdi endpoint. Reviewed code for direct string interpolation without sanitization or parameterization. Generated PoC payloads. High severity rating (8/10).
